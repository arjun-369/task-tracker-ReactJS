understand the code and work flow
other packages used here are
-json server(used as a dummy backend server + db)
-react-router-dom(used for routing and linking)

need to learn and understand Hooks,promises,async functions,await and other js stuff.

commands to run for the entire project to run
"npm start" - starts the react app
"npm run server" - starts the json sever


it is worthwhile to rewatch this video a number of times to understand how react works
and also learn how other packages are used for smoother working of the application.
